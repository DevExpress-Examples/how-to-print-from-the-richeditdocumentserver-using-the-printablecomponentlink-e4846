# How to print from the RichEditDocumentServer using the PrintableComponentLink


<p>This example demonstrates how to use a <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraPrintingPrintableComponentLinktopic"><u>PrintableComponentLink</u></a> to print from the RichEditDocumentServer. An instance of the RichEditDocumentServer loads a document, inserts a datetime stamp in its header and prints it.<br> Various print options, such as page size, orientation and margins are set in code at run time.<br> The WinForms application searches a list of installed printers for a printer containing a certain text ("Canon") in its name and prints to it. If a printer is not found, the default printer is used.</p>
